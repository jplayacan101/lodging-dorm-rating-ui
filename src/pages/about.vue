      <h1 class="text-h4 q-mb-md">Welcome to the Lodging and Dorm Rating System (LDRS)</h1>
      <p class="q-mb-md">
        The LDRS aims to provide a service wherein the public may efficiently and systematically search for and review lodging and dormitory facilities within the Katipunan, Barangka, and Pansol areas via a user rating system.
      </p>
      <p class="q-mb-md">
        It is intended to allow users, especially those potentially interested in living spaces in these areas for their proximity to ADMU and UP, easy access to a central database providing them with peer-reviewed information on the quality of available accommodations and housingâ€”aiding them in their choice of lodging.
      </p>
      <p class="q-mb-md">
        The LDRS includes the creation of a database of accommodations within these locations, the implementation of searching, rating, reviewing, and filtering functionalities, the design of a user-friendly interface for browsing and submitting reviews, and the integration of administrative tools for managing user accounts and moderating content.
